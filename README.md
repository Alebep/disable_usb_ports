# disable_usb_ports

This code allows you to enable and disable USB ports on computers running the Windows operating system. It does not cut power to the ports but instead disables them at the driver level, making them inaccessible.

## Usage

1. Run the `Command prompt` or `Powershell` as an administrator in your Windows machine.

2. Clone the repository: 

    ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/Alebep/disable_usb_ports.git
    ```

3. Head over to the directory: 

    ```bash
    cd disable_usb_ports
    ``` 
4. Run the python script:

    ```bash
    python disable_usb.py
    ```
A menu will appear with a list of operations for you to choose from.
